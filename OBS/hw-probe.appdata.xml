    <p>
      A tool to probe for hardware, check operability and find drivers with
      the help of Linux Hardware Database.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probe â€” is a snapshot of your computer hardware state.
      The tool checks operability of devices by analysis of logs and
      returns a permanent url to view the probe of the computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The probes are intended to simplify collecting of logs necessary for
      investigating hardware related problems. Just run one simple command
      to check hardware and collect all the system logs at once:
    </p>
    <p>
      sudo -E hw-probe -all -upload
    </p>
    <p>
      If some of hardware devices don't work due to a missed driver
      then the tool will suggest a proper Linux kernel version according
      to the LKDDb or third-party drivers.
    </p>

      By creating a probe, you contribute to the HDD/SSD desktop-class
      reliability study: https://github.com/linuxhw/SMART
